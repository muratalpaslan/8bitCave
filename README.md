# 8bitCave Theme

A retro-inspired VS Code theme that brings the nostalgic charm of 8-bit aesthetics to your modern development environment.

## Recommended Settings

To fully embrace the retro aesthetic of the 8bitCave Theme, we recommend using the following font settings in your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Press Start 2P', 'Fira Code', Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
  "editor.fontSize": 15,
  "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "'Press Start 2P', 'Fira Code', Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
  "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 15
}
```

These settings combine the pixelated look of 'Press Start 2P' with the readability and ligatures of 'Fira Code'. You can, of course, use any font you prefer.

Below is a screenshot showing an example of these recommended settings in action:
